# Sensing_assisted communication for UAV networks (To be continued...)
Code for [*Intelligent Sensing-assisted Communication for Cooperative Connected UAV networks*]() 
## Basic
partical raw sensing dataset has been updload, including UWB and MPU 6050.

The phases of antennas can be adjusted based on MIMO simulation.
